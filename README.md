## Interim-snippets
Since the main Chapter folders contain only the finished code for each chapter,
I have added additional folders containing the files as they appear for a
given stage of each chapter.

Where there are interim files for the chapter, you can find those files in the 
   chXX folder within a sub-folder for each section. Where the edit to a 
   particular file brings it in line with the final version, that file is not 
   included in the interim tree.

Since bold text doesn't apply well in code files, I have tried to mark changed 
   lines with a comment. Where an entire block is new or changed, there is a 
   hashtag on the line following the end of changed lines.
